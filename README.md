This provides a Swift client for talking to [Vert.x](http://vertx.io)
via the
[vertx-tcp-eventbus-bridge](https://github.com/vert-x3/vertx-tcp-eventbus-bridge).

It has only been tested with [Swift 3.0](https://swift.org/download/),
and only on MacOS X.

## Running the tests

`make test`

The tests build a Vert.x server and launch it, so you'll need Java (8
or higher) and maven installed.
